# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

**Layout: single-context.** One `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root, ADRs under `docs/adr/`.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root — the STRATOS domain glossary. It exists; read it.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. This
  directory does not exist yet; `/domain-modeling` creates it when the first decision
  is actually recorded.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

`CONTEXT.md` is the *domain* vocabulary. It does not replace `CODEMAP.md`, which
`AGENTS.md` requires you to read before substantial work — that one maps routes,
domain entrypoints, state ownership, and architecture guardrails. Read both; they
answer different questions.

## File structure

Single-context repo (this repo):

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-....md
│   └── 0002-....md
└── src/
```

If STRATOS ever splits into genuinely separate contexts, switch to a root
`CONTEXT-MAP.md` pointing at one `CONTEXT.md` per context, with context-scoped ADRs
under `src/<context>/docs/adr/`, and update this file.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because…_
